# Simple E-Commerce Web Application - Project Proposal

## Title
**Simple E-Commerce Web Application with .NET Core**

## Project Overview

Our Simple E-Commerce Web Application is a comprehensive online shopping platform designed to demonstrate modern web development practices using the .NET technology stack with Blazor. The application serves as both a functional e-commerce solution and a learning platform for understanding key concepts in web development, including Blazor component architecture, database management, user authentication, and responsive design.

The application addresses the growing need for small businesses and entrepreneurs to establish an online presence without the complexity and cost of enterprise-level e-commerce platforms. By providing essential e-commerce functionality in a clean, maintainable codebase, this project offers a foundation that can be easily understood, modified, and extended by developers at various skill levels.

What makes this project particularly valuable is its focus on demonstrating best practices in .NET development while maintaining simplicity and clarity. The application showcases real-world implementation of Entity Framework Core for data persistence, ASP.NET Identity for secure user management, and responsive design principles for cross-device compatibility. This makes it an excellent educational tool and a solid starting point for actual business applications.

- **As an admin**, I want to update product information so customers have accurate details
- **As an admin**, I want to manage stock levels so customers know what's available
- **As a business owner**, I want role-based access so only authorized users can manage products

## Technical Considerations

### Data Storage
The application will use **SQLite** as the primary database with **Entity Framework Core** for data access. SQLite provides a lightweight, file-based database solution perfect for development and small-scale deployments. Key data entities include:
- **Users**: Store user credentials, roles, and profile information
- **Products**: Product details including name, description, price, stock quantity, and images
- **Shopping Carts**: Temporary storage for user selections before checkout
- **Categories**: Product categorization for better organization
- **Roles**: User permission levels (Customer, Admin)

### User Accounts
The application implements **ASP.NET Identity** for comprehensive user management:
- **Registration**: Email-based account creation with password requirements
- **Authentication**: Secure login/logout with session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for admin functions
- **Password Security**: Hashed password storage and validation
- **Session Management**: Secure user sessions with timeout handling

### External Services
- **Bootstrap CDN**: For responsive UI components and styling
- **Font Awesome**: For icons and visual elements
- **SQLite**: Lightweight file-based database (no external hosting required)
- **Future Integration Points**: Payment gateways, email services, image hosting

### Device Compatibility
The application is designed for **cross-platform compatibility**:
- **Desktop Browsers**: Full functionality on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile Devices**: Responsive design optimized for smartphones and tablets
- **Touch Interface**: Mobile-friendly navigation and interaction
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

### Basic Security
Security measures implemented throughout the application:
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries through Entity Framework
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **Authentication**: Secure password hashing and session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- **HTTPS**: Secure data transmission (production deployment)
- **CSRF Protection**: Anti-forgery tokens for state-changing operations

### Development Environment
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 6.0 or later with Blazor Server
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code
- **Database**: SQLite for development and production
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub repository
- **Package Management**: NuGet for .NET dependencies
- **Testing**: Unit testing framework integration ready

This project proposal provides a solid foundation for building a functional e-commerce application while maintaining realistic scope for a semester-long project. The focus on core functionality ensures that each feature can be implemented thoroughly and tested properly, resulting in a polished final product that demonstrates professional development practices.
